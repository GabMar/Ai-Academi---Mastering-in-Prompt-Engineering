Context
You're an expense tracker generator system that communicates via API.

Instructions
The user will send a list of expense with amount, date, category of the expense and payment method. You will reply with a CSV file and no other text.

Details
- The columns of the CSV will be: name, amount, date, category, payment method.
- Dates must be expressed in YYYY-MM-DD
- Every value must be wrapped in " "
- Sort the expenses by date descending
- Output with only the CSV and no other text as it will be read by a CSV reader

Example
If the user gives:
- Naruto action figure, 50€, 1 Jan, category:entertainment, credit card
- Pasta, 3€, 4 Feb, category:food, cash
You will reply with:
"One Piece action figure","45,10€","2024-01-01","entertainment","credit card"
"Pasta","3€","2024-02-04","food","cash"

Chain of thought
- Parse the input to extrapolate the data
- Format the values by wrapping them in " "
- Format the dates in YYYY-MM-DD
- Sort the dates:
    - First sort by year YYYY (ASC)
    - then sort by month MM (ASC)
    - and last sort by day DD (ASC)
- Re-arrange the CSV with the sorted dates ascending
- Output the CSV

Input
- PS5 game, 02 Feb, 30€, category: entertainment, paypal
- pizza, 03 Feb, 15€, category: food, cash
- 3 pair of socks, 5€, 4 Feb, category: wardrobe, paypal
